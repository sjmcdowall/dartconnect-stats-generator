# Session Summary - October 11, 2025
## Major Fixes and Improvements to DartConnect Stats Generator

### Overview
This session focused on fixing critical bugs in the statistics calculation pipeline, particularly for wins/losses and Quality Points (QPs). All calculations now accurately reflect the league rules and game structure.

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. Wins/Losses Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Wins and losses were being counted per LEG instead of per GAME (Set).
- Example: Marc Bopp showed 21W-13L (leg wins) but actually played only 15 games with 9W-6L

**Solution**: 
- Updated `_estimate_games_played()` to count unique `(Report Link, Set #)` combinations
- Updated `_calculate_game_specific_stats()` to determine game winners by counting who won the majority of legs in each Set
- Files modified: `src/pdf_generator.py` (lines 834-892)

**Result**: Games Played, Wins, and Losses now correctly reflect actual games (Sets) played, not legs.

---

### 2. 501 Quality Points Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: The `_estimate_qps()` method was completely fake:
- Used non-existent 'score' column
- Arbitrary thresholds (‚â•180, ‚â•140)
- Multiplied by 10 with no basis
- Ignored actual game data

**Solution**:
- Created `_calculate_501_qps_from_csv()` method
- Uses `Hi Turn` column for turn score QPs
- Uses `DO` (Dart Out) column for checkout QPs
- Implements proper QP thresholds per league rules:
  - **Turn QPs**: 95-115 (1), 116-131 (2), 132-147 (3), 148-163 (4), 164-180 (5)
  - **Checkout QPs**: 61-84 (1), 85-106 (2), 107-128 (3), 129-150 (4), 151-170 (5)
- QPs are ADDITIVE - one leg can earn from both columns!
- Files modified: `src/pdf_generator.py` (lines 908-967)

**Result**: Marc Bopp - 24 QPs from 501 (realistic, was ~240 before!)

---

### 3. Cricket Quality Points Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Cricket QP calculation was fundamentally broken:
- Used `ending_marks` (total game score) instead of turn-by-turn data
- Applied bogus conversion formula (divide by 20/15/10)
- Example: 263 ending marks ‚Üí 13 "hits" ‚Üí 5 QPs (wrong!)
- Marc Bopp showed 72 Cricket QPs (way too high)

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `_parse_cricket_game()` to parse turn-by-turn data
- Created `_parse_cricket_turn()` to extract marks and bulls from turn score strings
  - Parses strings like "T20, S20" or "SB, DB, S19"
  - Counts marks (hits on 15-20) properly accounting for T/D/S multipliers
  - Counts bulls (SB=1, DB=2)
- Created `_calculate_turn_qp()` to apply proper QP rules to each turn
- Tracks maximum QP earned in any single turn per game
- Files modified: `src/url_fetcher.py` (lines 331-511)

**QP Rules Implemented**:
- 1 QP: 5H, 3H+1B, 2H+2B
- 2 QP: 6H, 3B, 1H+3B, 3H+2B, 4H+1B
- 3 QP: 7H, 4B, 1H+4B, 2H+3B, 4H+2B, 5H+1B
- 4 QP: 8H, 5B, 2H+4B, 3H+3B, 5H+2B, 6H+1B
- 5 QP: 9H, 6B, 3H+4B, 6H+2B

**Result**: Marc Bopp - 17 Cricket QPs (realistic, was 72 before!)

---

### 4. QP Integration in PDF Generator
**Problem**: PDF generator wasn't using enhanced_data from URL fetcher

**Solution**:
- Modified `_get_division_teams()` to store enhanced_data (line 720)
- Updated `_calculate_player_stats()` to accept and pass enhanced_data (line 776)
- Created `_calculate_total_qps()` to combine 501 + Cricket QPs (lines 885-897)
- Created `_get_cricket_qps_for_player()` to extract Cricket QPs from enhanced_data (lines 969-980)
- Files modified: `src/pdf_generator.py`

---

### 5. UI/Layout Improvements
**Problem**: Sub/Forfeit/Default placeholder rows took up space with no data

**Solution**:
- Removed 4 placeholder rows (2√óSub, Forfeit, Default) from each team
- Replaced with single empty row for visual separation
- Files modified: `src/pdf_generator.py` (lines 1035-1038, 636-638)

**Result**: Cleaner, more compact PDF output

## üìä Verified Results

### Marc Bopp Statistics (Current Data - 1/3 Season)
- **Legs**: 34 (16 √ó 501, 18 √ó Cricket)
- **Games**: 15 (9W - 6L)
- **501 QPs**: 24
- **Cricket QPs**: 17
- **Total QPs**: 41
- **QP%**: 120.59%
- **Win%**: 60.00%
- **Rating**: 2.4059

### Rating Formula (Verified Correct)
```
Rating = ((total_wins √ó 2) / games_played) + (qps / legs_played)
```
- Win Component: (9 √ó 2) / 15 = 1.200
- QP Component: 41 / 34 = 1.206
- Total: 2.406

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Games vs Legs**: Critical distinction
   - LEG = Single scoring unit (best of 3 darts)
   - GAME/SET = Multiple legs (best of 3 or 5)
   - MATCH = Multiple games

2. **QP Rules**: Must be calculated per-turn, not per-game
   - 501: Based on single turn high score + checkout
   - Cricket: Based on marks+bulls in single best turn

3. **Data Structure**: 
   - CSV has leg-level data
   - Must aggregate to game level for W/L
   - Must use turn-by-turn for Cricket QPs

4. **Official Data Source**: 
- `data/season74/by_leg_export.csv`
   - This is 1/3 of season (34 legs vs 83 in sample PDF)
